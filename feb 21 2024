It has serial communication AND Paralle communication.

Serial  =one wire between sender and receiver 

Parallel= many wire between this

LSB least significant Bit 
MSB = most significant But
In any bits 8 or 16

example: 00111011

Right side  is LSB
left Side in MSB

10111041

Serial Data Communication 2 methach.

â†’ Synchronous: clock is. transmitted with The data

 Asynchronous: No dock is transmitled.

[Transmitt and recived  agree on a clock speed for th date transmission] [Badrate

The dock is not connected but it will conneted on signals or some 

UART /USART

USART is full Duplex 

universal Asynchronous Reiver I Transmitter universal synchronous Reciver / transmitter.

Duplex:

Date Tx and Rx. [mobile]   Rx= Reciver.

Simplex:

Data can be transmitter only or vucerad. Cone direction only] [Radio]

Half duplex:

only one cary at a time [walky talky]

Full Duplex:

both ways at a time [mobile]
