RAM is the primary storage, which is volatile.
Secondary memory is non-volatile, and it includes storage devices like hard drives and SSDs.
Static RAM (SRAM) is faster than Dynamic RAM (DRAM).
DRAM is made up of capacitors and is volatile.
Cortex M is a microprocessor that contains only the processor. If it contains 176KB of program memory, it's called a microcontroller.
The system bus is the median that connects peripherals to the processor. It has eight buses.
GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) is a peripheral that allows communication with the outside environment.
The CPU knows only addition and other operations are performed by the architecture.
The CPU communicates with the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) via the AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus) at high speed.
The clock speed is 180 MHz
