GPIO--have 7 memory space and address, that memory space is called registers

registers 
 *MODER
 *OTYPER
 *OSPEEDR
 *PUPDR
 *IDR
 *ODR
 *BSRR
 *LCKR
 *AFRL
 *AFRH
 
 GPIO A base address will be -> 0x40020000
 when will know the base address of GPIOA and we know the offset 0x00 then we can know the place


 moder register:
    A= base address +off set value  :0x00

    start address will be a

  otyper register
     base address +offset :0x04 


   pheripheral base =4000 0000 
   pheripheral offset = 20000

   so value will be 40020000

   if both address are same then the offset will be 0

   when we use the (volatile unsigned int *) then use call as address

   integer pointer typecast pannumpothu(rcc base +AHBIEN_R_OFFSET ) will be changed as address


   (*(volatile unsigned int *)(RCC-base+ahb1en-r offset))

   the first pointer will save the valus to it
